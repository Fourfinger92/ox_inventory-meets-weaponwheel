# ox inventory meets weapon wheel
ox_inventory meets weaponwheel with hotbar

I made some changes in the files that I provide here to have a weaponwheel with the full functions of ox_inventory (ammo/reload/usage)

Try to replace your files with the file I provide. If needed I can provide you my complete ox_inventory or provide support for implementing my files in your ox_inventory.

Trigger the event "ausnahmewaffenrad" to disable the sync between weaponwheel and ox_inventory (e.g. for FFA).

# Example:

TriggerEvent("ausnahmewaffenrad",true)

to deactivate the sync

TriggerEvent("ausnahmewaffenrad",false)

to enable it again

# Happy for suggestions, improvements and found bugs :)

Tested with version 2.38.1

All love and appreciation goes to overextended, they are making the best inventory for FiveM out there!
