# ox_inventory-meets-weaponwheel
ox_inventory meets weaponwheel with hotbar

I made some changes in the files that I provide here to have a weaponwheel with the full functions of ox_inventory (ammo/reload/usage)

Trigger the event "ausnahmewaffenrad" to disable the sync between weaponwheel and ox_inventory (e.g. for FFA).

Example:

TriggerEvent("ausnahmewaffenrad",true)

to deaktivate the sync

TriggerEvent("ausnahmewaffenrad",false)

to enable it again
